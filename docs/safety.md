# Safety

Flux must default to conservative behavior.

## Execution Modes

Write-capable workflows should support dry-run and apply modes. Dry-run should be the default where an operation could move, delete, download, import, or mutate files. Apply should be explicit and gated by safety checks.

## Staging

Downloads should stage into controlled Flux-owned directories before any handoff. Automated staging must avoid writing directly into a real music library.

## Quarantine And Rejected

Suspicious, incomplete, unsupported, or policy-failing items should be isolated into quarantine or rejected areas rather than imported. Quarantine is for reviewable uncertainty. Rejected is for objective failures that remain excluded from handoff.

## Cleanup

Cleanup must be conservative. Automatic deletion should only apply to delete-eligible items with objective failures and clear retention policy. No auto-delete behavior is active in the bootstrap project.

## Path Safety

Future file operations must enforce path containment, symlink protection, and path traversal protection. Resolved paths must stay inside the intended Flux-controlled root before moves, writes, cleanup, or handoff.

## Tests

Automated tests must not use a real music library. Tests must not perform real downloads, call real download services, require private credentials, or depend on personal filesystem paths.
