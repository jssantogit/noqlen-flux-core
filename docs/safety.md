# Safety

Flux must default to conservative behavior.

## Execution Modes

Write-capable workflows should support dry-run and apply modes. Dry-run should be the default where an operation could move, delete, download, import, or mutate files. Apply should be explicit and gated by safety checks.

Workspace initialization follows this rule. `noqlen-flux workspace init PATH --dry-run` reports planned directory creation without writing to disk. `noqlen-flux workspace init PATH --apply` is required before Flux creates missing workspace directories.

## Workspace Root

The workspace root is the Flux-controlled boundary for staging and generated state. It is normalized with `pathlib` before use. Future workflows must operate inside this root unless a separate safety boundary is explicitly designed.

The initial workspace layout contains these automatic directories:

- `incoming`
- `approved`
- `quarantine`
- `rejected`
- `reports`
- `manifests`
- `cache`
- `tmp`

## Staging

Downloads should stage into controlled Flux-owned directories before any handoff. Automated staging must avoid writing directly into a real music library.

## Quarantine And Rejected

Suspicious, incomplete, unsupported, or policy-failing items should be isolated into quarantine or rejected areas rather than imported. Quarantine is for reviewable uncertainty. Rejected is for objective failures that remain excluded from handoff.

## Cleanup

Cleanup must be conservative. Automatic deletion should only apply to delete-eligible items with objective failures and clear retention policy. No auto-delete behavior is active in the bootstrap project.

## Path Safety

Future file operations must enforce path containment, symlink protection, and path traversal protection. Resolved paths must stay inside the intended Flux-controlled root before moves, writes, cleanup, or handoff.

Path traversal attempts that resolve outside the workspace are blocked. Symlinks that resolve outside the workspace are also blocked before Flux plans or applies directory operations.

Protected roots can be configured for service calls. Any target inside a protected root is rejected, and a workspace root that would contain a protected root is rejected. CLI environment support is intentionally minimal and only uses the `NOQLEN_FLUX_` prefix.

## Tests

Automated tests must not use a real music library. Tests must not perform real downloads, call real download services, require private credentials, or depend on personal filesystem paths.

Workspace and safety tests use temporary directories only. Tests must not use real music directories, personal download folders, or device storage paths.
